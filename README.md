🐭 rdmpass 🔑
Get real random passwords made from how you move.
rdmpass makes safe passwords by using what no computer can guess: you. It turns the wild, mixed-up data from your mouse moves into a start of true, top-quality randomness.

✨ Main Ideas
At its core, rdmpass runs on true randomness.

🖱️ Mouse Chaos: It takes the basic stuff from how your mouse moves—how fast, quick changes, shakes, and stops. This hands-on input gives a random source of data, new every time.

🎲 Not Just Guessing: Not like usual rand() ways that use set math ways, rdmpass gets its randomness from the real world. This means its results can't be guessed.

🚀 Top Things to Know
🔒 Unbreakable Starts

The randomness comes from a random real thing. This means it's a start no big computer can guess, model, or know. It happens just once, never the same again.

🔐 Better Safe From Tough Attacks

Passwords made from real randomness can fight off the most smart guess and attack ways that could break into weak random number make-ups.

✨ Easy, Clean, and Quick

Make a strong, full password with just a quick move of your hand. No hard setups, just wild, mixed-up moves made into safe-keeping.

Why use a guessable plan when you can trust the great mess of human-made randomness?
